The book "Systemantics by John Gall" is a fantastic book to discover properties of a "system" in general. From this book's point of view, system can be any size, the system will appear in society from individual to technology to the world in general. It took mesaures from all the subjects and tried to build a "axiomitic" approach to the situation, was written with the hope of giving a better understanding to the future generation. This book was written when large computational system was the topic of science fiction, but it's genuine approach to the subject makes it worthy to go back, and gather what treasue was hidden inside of this book. I had a nice time with this book and I think, I could work on this book in a broader way if I get chance in the coming days. A very interesting topic would be to project these ideas into the new field of distributed computational systems, and in fact those ideas are still hold values today.
