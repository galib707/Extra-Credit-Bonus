The book "Systemantics by John Gall" is a fantastic book to discover properties of a "system" in general. From this books point of view, system can be any size, the system can dwell in society to individual to technology to the world in general. It took mesaures of all the subjects and tried to build a "axiomitic" approach to the situation, with hope of better understanding for future generation. This book was written when large computational system was the topic of science fiction, but it's genuine approach to the subject makes it worthy to go back, and read what treasue was hidden inside of this book. I had a nice time with this book and I think I could works on this book in a broader way if I get chance in coming days. A very interesting topic would be to project his old ideas into our new distributed computational systems, and in fact those ideas are still hold values today.
